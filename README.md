# Understanding Rayls
This project is build to develop a better understanding of Rayls ecosystem using the Rayls documentation here - https://docs.rayls.com/docs/a-warm-introduction-to-rayls and draft a tentative testing strategy with a test automation framework for the Rayls system.

## Understanding Rayls as a Product
Rayls positions itself as a bridge between Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), introducing the concept of UniFi.

### 1. Value Proposition
- Unification of TradFi and DeFi ecosystems
- Enterprise-grade privacy and scalability for financial institutions
- Regulatory compliance while maintaining innovation
- Cross-border transaction capabilities

### 2. Target Players
- **Financial Institutions**:
  - Banks and financial service providers
  - Asset management firms
  - Trading platforms
- **DeFi Protocols**:
  - Lending platforms
  - Decentralized exchanges
  - Asset tokenization services

### 3. Product Features
- Infrastructure for Token issuance and management
- Cross-chain asset transfers
- Private transaction processing
- Institutional-grade custody solutions
- Interoperability with major DeFi protocols cross-chains

## Understanding Rayls Technical Set-Up
Rayls is a blockchain system built on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) technology, consisting of several key technical components:

### 1. Architecture Components
- **Rayls Public Chain**: An Ethereum L2 permissionless chain with mandatory KYC
- **Rayls Private Subnets**: An EVM Permissioned blockchain environment with enterprise-grade privacy
- **Rayls Token**: Governance and utility token unifying the ecosystem

### 2. Technical Features
- Advanced cryptography implementation (Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption)
- Cross-chain communication capabilities
- EVM compatibility for smart contract development
- Enterprise-grade privacy and scalability

### 3. Integration Points
- **SDK Features**:
  - Cross-chain message sending
  - Endpoint management
  - Resource registration
  - Transfer metadata handling
  
- **API Components**:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Token management
  - Transaction processing
  - Wallet operations

### 4. Security & Compliance
- Mandatory KYC for public chain accounts
- Privacy-preserving (encryption and decryption) technology in private subnets
- Enterprise-grade security measures
- Regulatory compliance management using Governance and Auditor contracts

## Product Key Benefits and how they can be achieved using various Tech Components
- **For TradFi**:
  - Access to DeFi innovation : ( Public Chain Component of Rayls enables access to DEFI ) 
  - Maintained privacy and security : ( Privacy Ledgers with encryption/decrytion feature using secure algorithms like ZK Proofs helps achieve privacy and security )
  - Regulatory compliance : ( Governance module in Privacy Ledger allows tradfi systems to define and implement their rules )
  - Enterprise-grade scalability : ( Privacy Ledgers are designed to handle more than 10000 TPS throughput making the infrastructure highly scalable )

- **For DeFi**:
  - Access to traditional financial infrastructure : ( Public Chain allows DEFI systems to talk to Private Subnets which has access to TradFi infrastructure )
  - Broader user base and Increased liquidity : ( With increased privacy, larger institutions can bring more money and users to DEFI systems using Rayls private subnets and public blockchain to access )
  - Enhanced security features : ( Even public blockchain requires every account created on it to be KYCd hence increasing security )
